Pizza is good. 

Here are some of my favourite toppings: 

Provalone or Havarti cheese
Goat Cheese
Tomato 
Green Pepper 
Sometimes chicken
Basil leaves
Pesto sauce is nice 
Hot peppers 
Olive oil 
Mushrooms sometimes 
SPINACH
FRESH MOZZARELLA 
SMALL AMOUNT OF GARLIC
SMALL AMOUNR OF ONION

Such yum. Very Nice.
